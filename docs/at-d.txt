@d      descriptor
  This is a whole topic. 'd' is short for display. The descriptor is an
  optional object specifier, an optional method specifier and an optional
  object var specifier. Anything after the first '.' is a method specifier.
  Anything after the first "'" or '"' is a var specifier where single quote
  refers to object state associated with the specified object and double quote
  refers to all state on the object.

  An object can be a $ref, #num or an in-world reference like 'here' or 'me'.

  Multiple objects can be specified by separating them with commas.

  Method specifiers use shell glob matching
